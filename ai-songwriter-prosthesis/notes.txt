Perplexity for the fact

Grok for the writer - make it an agentic rap battle

Songwriter personality / Band

Band can be the multi-hats

And that includes the researcher / and fact checker

Use gemini batch api for the parallel brainstorm?

}

Present user with opening verse options; user chooses which one they prefer; that one is used in the creation prompt, to follow that vibe style

The two options are editable so user can tweak them, still tracking human vs machine

Save user preferences to get smarter? Like history of what the user likes for references?

Ability for critics to suggest changes to individual lines. Do we then change them outright, or give the songwriter a set of revisions to choose from, if they make sense in the larger context?

Stream back the result

Entry form for filling in sections, or lyric lines -- optional

Then sections are kept as, and the machine fills them in 

Return version that is 'from scratch' based on the theme, and another that's filled in with the human-provided components

Get meme - can just enter it along with the quotes

Should theme be "inspiration"?

With feature that has if use verbatim to have it in quotes

Line number corrections


Different temps / model settings for the persona types (e.g., facts vs creativity)

## Key Structural Changes and Rationale

| Old Directory/File | New Directory/File | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `app/prompts/song_prompts.py` | `config/prompts/prompts.yaml` (external) | **Decoupling and Version Control.** Moves all prompt strings out of Python code into an external, versionable YAML file, facilitating easier prompt engineering without code changes. `prompt_manager.py` will load this. |
| `app/utils/config.py` (assumed) | `app/config/settings.py` & `config/app_settings.yaml` | **Standardized Configuration.** Separates code-level settings (Pydantic settings) from deployment-level configuration (YAML file) for models, temperatures, and thresholds. |
| (None) | `app/tools/` | **Agentic Best Practice.** Creates a standard location for defining function-calling or structured-output tools (e.g., `search_tool.py`, `lyrics_parser_tool.py`) that are explicitly passed to and utilized by the Agents (especially `Collaborator` and `Planner`). |
| (None) | `app/agents/planner.py` | **Dynamic Control.** Dedicated location for the new `PlannerAgent` that dictates the sequential flow of actions in the graph, replacing fixed graph edges with dynamic action selection. |
| `app/agents/collaborator.py`, `app/agents/researcher.py` | **(Files remain, but content changes)** | **Tool Adoption.** These agents are modified to *use* the tools in `app/tools/` (e.g., `Collaborator` uses the `lyrics_parser_tool` and `search_tool`) rather than having embedded logic or relying on the flow for research. |
| `app/graph/state.py` | **(File remains, but content changes)** | **Provenance Tracking.** The `SongWritingState` Pydantic model is updated to support line-level traceability, including `origin` and `revision_of` fields. |

I can't generate and provide a downloadable PDF file directly. However, I can write out the **complete, detailed instructions** for restructuring your AI Songwriting application into a single, well-formatted text that you can easily copy and paste into a document (like Google Docs, Word, or a text editor) and save as a PDF yourself. ðŸ“„

Here is the full restructuring plan, incorporating the move to **Producer**, **Lyracist**, and **Brainstormers**, along with the new **Tools** and **Configuration** directories.

# AI Songwriting Application Restructuring Plan

This document outlines the necessary changes to the project structure, file renames, and high-level conceptual shifts to modernize the AI Songwriting application, focusing on agent autonomy, traceability, and external configuration.

## 1. Project Structure Overhaul

The following table details the required file system changes. **New** directories/files are marked, and **Renamed/Modified** files are noted.

| Path | Status | Change Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **config/** (Top-Level) | **NEW Directory** | Stores external configuration files. |
| **config/prompts/** | **NEW Directory** | Stores all prompt templates. |
| `config/prompts/prompts.yaml` | **NEW File** | **Externalized Prompt Templates.** Replaces `app/prompts/song_prompts.py`. |
| `config/app_settings.yaml` | **NEW File** | Stores model names, temperatures, thresholds, and container settings. |
| **app/agents/** | **Directory** | Contains all specialized agent classes. |
| `app/agents/collaborator.py` | **DELETE/RENAME** | Renamed to `lyracist.py`. |
| `app/agents/lyracist.py` | **NEW/RENAMED** | The core drafting/revising agent. |
| `app/agents/brainstorm.py` | **DELETE/RENAME** | Renamed to `brainstormers.py`. |
| `app/agents/brainstormers.py` | **NEW/RENAMED** | Contains YesAnd, NoBut, NonSequitur agents. |
| `app/agents/planner.py` | **DELETE/RENAME** | Renamed to `producer.py`. |
| `app/agents/producer.py` | **NEW/RENAMED** | The top-level strategic routing agent. |
| `app/agents/researcher.py` | **MODIFIED** | Updated to primarily call the `SearchTool`. |
| **app/tools/** | **NEW Directory** | Stores utility functions exposed to agents as formal tools. |
| `app/tools/search_tool.py` | **NEW File** | Wraps `SerpAPIWrapper` as a callable Tool object. |
| `app/tools/lyrics_parser_tool.py` | **NEW File** | Helper to parse/extract text from the new structured state. |
| `app/tools/rhyme_tool.py` | **NEW File** | Optional utility for rhyme/meter checking. |
| **app/graph/** | **Directory** | Contains LangGraph implementation. |
| `app/graph/state.py` | **MODIFIED** | Update `SongWritingState` for **Provenance Tracking**. |
| `app/graph/workflow.py` | **MODIFIED** | Simplified graph logic; now controlled by the `producer` node. |
| **app/utils/** | **Directory** | General helpers. |
| `app/utils/prompt_manager.py` | **MODIFIED** | Updated to load prompts from `config/prompts/prompts.yaml`. |
| `app/prompts/song_prompts.py` | **DELETE** | Prompts are now externalized. |

## 2. Agent Renaming and Role Changes

| Agent | Old Name (File/Class) | New Name (File/Class) | Primary Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Top-Level Orchestrator** | `collaborator`/`PlannerAgent` | **`producer.py`/`ProducerAgent`** | **Strategic Routing.** Sets the initial creative plan, monitors quality scores, and decides the next step (e.g., *revise chorus*, *skip fact-check*, *terminate*). |
| **Creative Drafter** | `collaborator.py`/`CollaboratorAgent` | **`lyracist.py`/`LyracistAgent`** | **Drafting & Revision.** Generates and revises lyrics, *calls tools* (e.g., `SearchTool`, `RhymeTool`) as needed, and adheres to the **Provenance Tracking** data structure. |
| **Parallel Feedback** | `brainstorm.py`/`*Agent` | **`brainstormers.py`/`*Brainstormer`** | Provides parallel feedback (YesAnd, NoBut, NonSequitur). Renamed the file to better reflect the collection of agents. |
| **Factual Agent** | `researcher.py`/`ResearcherAgent` | **`researcher.py`/`ResearcherAgent`** | Focuses solely on interacting with the `SearchTool` and formatting the resulting facts for the Lyracist. |

## 3. Critical Code Implementation Steps

### A. Provenance Tracking (Digital Property Rights)

**Location:** `app/graph/state.py` (`SongWritingState` TypedDict/Pydantic Model)

1.  **Structure Change:** The `draft_lyrics` field must be changed from a simple JSON/string to a list of structured objects (dictionaries).
2.  **Required Fields per Lyric Line:**
    * `line`: (`str`) The actual lyric text.
    * `origin`: (`str`) Must be one of: `"Human_Input"`, `"AI_Draft_V[n]"`, or `"AI_Revision_V[n]"`.
    * `revision_of`: (`str` or `None`) The previous line this line replaced, or `None` if it's new.
    * `section`: (`str`) E.g., `"Verse 1"`, `"Chorus"`.

### B. Configuration and Prompt Management

**Location:** `app/utils/prompt_manager.py` and new `config/` directory.

1.  **YAML Creation:** Create `config/prompts/prompts.yaml` and move all content from `app/prompts/song_prompts.py` into it using standard YAML syntax.
2.  **Loader Update:** Update `PromptManager` to use a YAML loader (e.g., PyYAML) to read templates from the file system instead of a hardcoded Python dictionary.

### C. Tool Integration

**Location:** `app/tools/` directory and Agent classes (`lyracist.py`, `researcher.py`).

1.  **Define Tools:** Create the tool files (e.g., `search_tool.py`) defining functions with clear docstrings and Pydantic schemas, ready for function-calling.
2.  **Agent Adoption:** Update the `LyracistAgent` to accept tools in its `__init__` and use structured output prompting to allow the LLM to decide when to call the tools. This makes the Lyracist self-sufficient in gathering information or parsing the state.

### D. Workflow Logic

**Location:** `app/graph/workflow.py`

1.  **Simplify Edges:** Replace many sequential or conditional edges with a single, crucial edge: `("producer", END_NODE)` and `("producer", [other_node])`.
2.  **Producer Node:** Ensure the `producer` node runs at the start of the loop. It reads the current state (scores, facts, lyrics) and outputs the next action (e.g., `"next_step": "lyracist"`) that the LangGraph router then follows.
