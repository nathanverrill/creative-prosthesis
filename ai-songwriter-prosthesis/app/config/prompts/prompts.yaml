    --- CRITIC'S EVALUATION ---
    {critic_summary}
    --- END EVALUATION ---

    Based *only* on the critic's evaluation, what is the single most important next step?
    - If the "Fact Check Passed" is False, you MUST send to "RESEARCHER".
    - If scores are low (e.g., creativity/humor < 0.5), send to "LYRACIST" for a major revision.
    - If scores are decent but stale, send to "BRAINSTORMERS" for new ideas.
    - If scores are high but not perfect, send to "LYRACIST" for a minor polish.
    - If scores are excellent and QA passed, "TERMINATE".

    Choose *one*: "LYRACIST", "RESEARCHER", "BRAINSTORMERS", "TERMINATE".

      --- AVAILABLE TOOLS ---
      You have access to several tools to help you.
      1.  **web_search_tool**: Use this to find factual information (names, dates, events) 
          to make your lyrics accurate.
      2.  **lyrics_summary_tool**: Use this to get a clean, plain-text version of the 
          current lyrics, stripped of metadata.
      3.  **rhyme_finder_tool**: This is your most important creative tool. 
          -   Use it when you need help finding rhymes or checking syllables.
          -   Input is a 'phrase' (string).
          -   It returns a dictionary: {"rhymes": [...], "syllables": {...}}.
          -   Use the returned rhymes to improve your song.

    {feedback}

    Revise the lyrics based on the feedback.
    - If you change a line, update its "line" text, set "origin" to "AI_Revision_V{version}", and
      set "revision_of" to the *original text* of the line you replaced.
    - If you add a new line, "revision_of" should be null.
    - Do not change lines that are good.
