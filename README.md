## Creative Prosthesis: AI-Assisted creativity

Creative Prosthesis is a set of open source APIs, applications, experiments and toolkits that provide modular, agentic AI components for **music composition, sound design, and visual generation**.

These tools are intended to be used like any other creative instrument: a means of expression and experimentation that extends, rather than replaces, human artistry. Developers and artists can integrate the components into their own environments or creative pipelines to build new forms of computational art and performance.

## 🤝 Shared Principles of Ownership

Creative Prosthesis is released as open-source software to empower creators and invite collaboration.  
While the Apache License allows unrestricted integration, **we hope you will** join us in upholding a  
simple principle: that **individuals retain ownership of the works they create** with these tools.

If you build applications or services using Creative Prosthesis, we ask — in the spirit of open  
authorship — that you respect and protect your users’ rights to their own generated works.  
In doing so, you help advance a broader cultural and legal recognition of human authorship  
in AI-assisted creativity.

This project also exists to **inspire thoughtful discourse** around digital property rights,  
creative agency, and the evolving definition of authorship in the age of machine collaboration.  
By engaging with Creative Prosthesis, you contribute not only code or art, but to the  
conversation shaping the future of creative ownership.
